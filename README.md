# Gift-Of-Time
## By: Sujay 
### Description
I was inspired by a fancy clock on Instagram called "A Million Times," and I wanted to make a more modern, practical and perhaps interactive version of it. So, I built a clock with the same core idea, but included a built-in speaker that can detect audio and display patterns to visualize the music, buttons for special and interactive effects, LED lights for a modern effect, and a screen that can control the information played (ie. customized text, weather, date). 

I made this project because I wanted to challenge myself and combine multiple different projects that I've been really interested in for the past few months, like building my own interactive speaker. I'm a beginner to hardware, so I also like the balance of convoluted but repetitive hardware and challenging software, helping me build on my current skills and learn something new.

Notes for reviewers:
- Although I've sourced most of the electronics at first from AliExpress, one of my cool friends said I could take some of the components I needed, so I won't be buying them with the Hack Club Grant. I've changed the prices of those items to $0
- By saving some money, I also decided to spend some on a growing concern about the noise of 48 servos, so I added soundproofing foam and wood to the BOM to make the clock complete.
- A lot of the CAD assembly has been worked on after submission, as I was trying to rush and submit the project in time.. (The procrastination was real) sorry about that :(
